Hi, my name is Jakub and I've been programming websites and applications since I was 13. I am now well versed in a multitude of programming languages, version control systems, databases, and all the other stuff.

I'm very fond of combining backend development, with deploying front-end solutions. I enjoy a challenge, and I'm highly interested in new technologies, methods, and solutions.

I basically like to try out new things (and/or write my own). I'd like to learn how to build better and better things day by day, and that's why I decided to start this blog. It's gonna be a learning experience for you and me! Win-win.
